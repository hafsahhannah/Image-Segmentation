# Image segmentation using MobileNet

## Description

An algorithm that can automatically detect nuclei to expedite research on a wide 
range of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and rare disorders. Such tool has 
the potential to significantly improve the speed at which cures are developed, 
benefiting those suffering from various health conditions, including chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and even the common cold.
Hence, the identification of cell nuclei is a crucial first step in many research studies 
because it enables researchers to analyze the DNA contained within the nucleus, 
which holds the genetic information that determines the function of each cell. By 
identifying the nuclei of cells, researchers can examine how cells respond to 
different treatments and gain insights into the underlying biological processes at 
play. An automated AI model for identifying nuclei, offers the potential to streamline 
drug testing and reduce the time for new drugs to become available to the public.


## Getting Started
